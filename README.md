- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Pibender
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in setting up a HELIUM mining device (Kerlink iFemtoCell Miner-915Mhz)
I have received the device, connected to my internet router, applied power and the device
appears to be functioning, but the onboarding process using the phone app has been unsuccessful.
Looking for guidance on setting this up and operating it to mine HNT. Can anyone provide instructions 
on getting the device up and active and how I can manage the account?
